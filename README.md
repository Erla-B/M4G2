I wanted to do something fun for this and decided on this simple cloud animation with a moving gradient background for fun! Probably simple for some, but it was a bit of a headache for me!

One problem I couldn't figure out was cloud1 not working with the other four clouds. Please do tell me if you know the reason! If I chose only 'cloud' for the hover all the clouds EXCEPT cloud1 would trigger. No idea why...it also makes the other clouds jump down a bit...

But I had fun and I think I managed to show what I was supposed to be able to do.
